StickHero-CSE201 is a game that allows players to control a stick figure hero and navigate them across a platform to capture cherries. 

The game involves multiple components such as the player, cherry, platform, and stick. The player component has attributes such as player name, score, and orientation. The cherry component has a score count and can be captured by the player. The platform component has a maximum and minimum width, and its width can be increased or decreased. The stick component has a minimum and maximum length and can be elongated. These components are connected through a main class called StickHeroMain, which allows players to add new players, start a new game, load a game, and exit the game. The game is built using JavaFX and may throw exceptions.
